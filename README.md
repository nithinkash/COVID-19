* :red_circle: This is just an onging research and cannot relay on the results yet*

>I used keras to Detect COVID-19 using chest X-ray <br/>
>The COVID-19 X-ray image dataset I am using was curated by Dr. Joseph Cohen,
>Dr. Cohen's [Git Repo](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset)

*Code usage*
```
python train_covid19.py --dataset dataset
```
>have use **Predictor.py** script to test the new images.<br />
>Should specify the image file name inside the code.<br />

**It will be accurate with more datasets any available dataset head me up**
